### What is API?

An API is a set of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. 
Think of it like a bridge that connects two systems and lets them share data or services.

To make this clearer, let’s use an example:


Imagine you’re at a restaurant. The waiter (API) takes your order (request), brings it to the chef (server), and then brings the food back to you (response).

Similarly, when you search for a course on a website, you send a request through an API, which then checks the database and sends the result back to you.
