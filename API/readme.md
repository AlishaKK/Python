### What is API?

An API is a set of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. 
Think of it like a bridge that connects two systems and lets them share data or services.

To make this clearer, let’s use an example:


Imagine you’re at a restaurant. The waiter (API) takes your order (request), brings it to the chef (server), and then brings the food back to you (response).

Similarly, when you search for a course on a website, you send a request through an API, which then checks the database and sends the result back to you.

**Traditional:**

* **Tightly Coupled:** Interdependent components.
* **Low Reusability:** Hard to reuse functionality.
* **Technology Limits:** Difficult to integrate different systems.
* **Monolithic:** Single, large applications.
* **Slow Development:** Building from scratch often required.
* **Complex Maintenance:** Changes risky and debugging hard.
* **Fragile:** Failures could cascade.

**APIs:**

* **Loosely Coupled:** Independent components.
* **High Reusability:** Easy to reuse functionality.
* **Technology Agnostic:** Enables integration across different systems.
* **Modular (Microservices):** Smaller, independent services.
* **Fast Development:** Leverage existing functionalities.
* **Easy Maintenance:** Independent updates and debugging.
* **Resilient:** Failures are often isolated.
* **Secure Access:** Controlled access to data and functions.
* **Abstracted:** Hides complexity.
* **Enables Sharing:** Facilitates data and function sharing.
* **Platform Independent:** Works across various environments.
