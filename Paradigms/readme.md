### **Programming Paradigms & Their Limitations**  

A **programming paradigm** is a way or style of writing code. Here are the main paradigms and their limitations:  

---

### **1. Procedural Programming** (C, Python, JavaScript)  
💡 **Concept:** Code is written as a sequence of step-by-step instructions (functions & procedures).  
❌ **Limitations:** Hard to manage for large programs; lacks data security (global variables).  

---

### **2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (Python, Java, C++)  
💡 **Concept:** Code is organized into objects with properties and behaviors (encapsulation, inheritance).  
❌ **Limitations:** More complex than procedural, higher memory usage, and can be slower.  

---

### **3. Functional Programming** (Haskell, Lisp, Python)  
💡 **Concept:** Uses pure functions (no side effects) and treats functions as first-class citizens.  
❌ **Limitations:** Difficult to learn, debugging can be hard, and sometimes inefficient in performance.  

---

### **4. Declarative Programming** (SQL, HTML, Prolog)  
💡 **Concept:** Focuses on **what** to do rather than **how** to do it (rules, constraints).  
❌ **Limitations:** Less control over execution, harder to debug, and can be less flexible.  

---

### **5. Event-Driven Programming** (JavaScript, Node.js)  
💡 **Concept:** Executes code in response to events (clicks, user actions).  
❌ **Limitations:** Can be difficult to debug and manage large applications.  

Each paradigm has strengths & weaknesses, and modern programming often **mixes paradigms** for better flexibility! 🚀
